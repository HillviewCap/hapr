# HAPR Wiki

**HAPR** (HAProxy Audit & Reporting Tool) is a Python CLI that audits HAProxy configurations against a 103-check security baseline across 13 categories. It parses configs, scores them, optionally performs live TLS scanning and CVE lookups, generates topology graphs, and produces self-contained HTML reports.
